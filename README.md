# Instrumental Variable Approach - A Remedy for Endogenity


This is for the final project for the course MATH 329 Probability & Statistics II in Fall 2019, including
paper submission and 25-minute oral presentation. 

## Works

* Investigated two regression methods - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and In-
strumental variable method (IV) - to show how IV method remedies a violation
of endogeneity condition, simultaneity bias, from the OLS method

* Applied the two regression methods to a sample dataset of the 2009 annual
report of the U.S. government, The Economic Report of the President, by using
R programming

## Software
